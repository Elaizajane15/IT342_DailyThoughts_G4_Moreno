# What I Did Right Now
- Create the repository and the backend 
- Reinitialized the existing Git repository in the project folder.
- Tried to add README.md; Git reported: `fatal: pathspec 'README.md' did not match any files`.
- Created this README and recorded the current actions.
- Organized frontend under `web/` with `index.html`.
- Added `web/css/styles.css` and `web/js/app.js`.
- Refactored `web/index.html` to use external CSS/JS assets.
- The page saves entries (“What I Did Right Now”) to local storage and lists them with timestamps.


## Next Steps

- Add and commit this file:
  - `git add README.md`
  - `git commit -m "Add README with activity log"`
-   Finish docs files in `docs/` (project overview, setup, usage).
-    Create mobile Kotlin app in `mobile/` (Android project scaffold).
